CHANGELOG
=========

Release 0.3 - PDF Access
-------------------------

* As a researcher, I want to browse a list of collections in order to
  select a subset of items to browse.
* As a researcher, I want to browse through a paginated list of all the
  books in a single collection in order to see the range of materials
  that are present.
* As a researcher, when looking at a list of books in a collection, I
  can view a PDF using my native PDF browser in order to view the
  contents of the book.
* As a researcher, I can search by simple keyword or phrase in order to
  find books that fit my interests.
* A search engine can harvest information about site content via site
  maps in order to index the content and make it more discoverable.
* As a researcher, I can select a text and pass it to Voyant to do text
  analysis for the purposes of my research.
* As a researcher, I want to be able to harvest contents into my Zotero
  library in order to facilitate research.
* As a researcher browsing a list of titles in a collection or search
  results, I want to see the author name and the year of publication
  so that if I am looking for a particular title or edition I have more
  information to identify it quickly without opening the pdf.
* As a researcher viewing keyword search results, I want to see titles
  or authors with matching terms higher in the list so that if I am
  searching for a title or author by keyword the item appears on the first
  or second page of results, and I don't have to page through all the
  results to find what I am looking for.
* As a user I can see a logo for the site, so I visually recognize that
  I am in a coherent site whenever I see it.
* As a user I see university branding on the site, so that I know that
  it is an Emory University resource.
* As a user I want to read a brief description of the content of a collection
  on the collection list page and individual collection pages, so that
  I can determine my level of interest in it.
* As an admin user, I want to be able to login with my Emory LDAP account
  so that I can re-use my existing credentials.
* As a user I can view a list of collections on the landing page by thumbnail
  image so that I can select an area of interest from visual cues.
* As a user, when viewing a single collection, I can see a visual cue of
  the collection's content, so that I can connect the item I see on the
  list view to the page I am viewing.
* As a researcher I can filter search results by collection facets, in
  order to see the material most relevant to my interests.
* As an admin, I can upload images and associate them with collections,
  so that I can manage thumbnail and splash images displayed on collection
  browse and display pages.
