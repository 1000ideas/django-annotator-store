    <p>The requested account is already in use, and has been
    associated with a <em>different</em> user account. This means you cannot
    associate it with your <em>current</em> user account. If you do need to
    link these accounts (e.g., to add a GitHub account so you can export
    annotations made with your current account to Github), please contact
    a Readux administrator to help resolve the problem.</p>
